# SYSTANCE - Stance Detection Project 
### By: Iris Dreizenshtok, Chen Avraham, Adi Avinun and Gal Tadir

We built a framework for comparing stance detection algorithms with 6 different datasets.

You can select up to three algorithms for comparison and one dataset each time.

The system will display the statistics of the algorithms and the dataset with the measures for each algorithm.

** You need to first fill the relevent tables using the DBManager by adding all the datasets (csv files) to the DB. One of the datasets is too large to add to GitHub, so you can download the dataset and add it yourself using the following link:

In addition, there is another section where you can enter a sentence, 
and one of the algorithms will classify the stance of the sentence according to existing classifications: Against, Neutral, Favor.

** Note that for this part you need additional files which do not exist in this repository since they are too large and pass the size limit of GitHub. 
You can download these file from the following link and add them to the TAN folder:
