# stance detection project


We built a framework for comparing stance detection algorithms with 6 different datasets.

You can select up to three algorithms for comparison and one dataset each time.

The system will display the statistics of the algorithms and the dataset with the measures for each algorithm.

In addition, there is another section where you can enter a sentence, 
and one of the algorithms will classify the stance of the sentence according to existing classifications: Against, Neutral, Favor.
Note that for this part you need additional files which do not exist in this repository since they are too large and pass the size limit of GitHub. 
You can download these file from the following link:
